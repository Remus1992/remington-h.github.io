        <h3>What Brings Me to Coding?</h3>
        <p>At the risk of sounding cliche, I'll begin with that my mother called me a renaissance man as child.
          For as long as I can remember, I've wanted to know everything I could about the world around me.
          I liked to read fact books and encycopedia passages as a child and have had an intersting path getting to where
          I am. Studying coding stems from a long-found interst in Artificial Intelligence and my desire to learn more about it.</p>

          <h3>What Are My Strengths?</h3>
          <p>It's a little early in my career for me to give specifics on what I would consider my strengths
            of coding directly, but I have a lot of skills that work towards team development and sucess. </p>
          <p>I have excellent public speaking abilities from my work as an Admissions Counselor where I
            would talk to different audiences almost daily.</p>
          <p>My small team communication skills are just as refined. I am actually an Eagle Scout and have
            spent a large amount of time working in small groups to achieve a common goal.</p>
          <p>I'm quite creative. On the personal side, I study filmmaking and have worn multiple hats on my
            own projects. On my most recent project, I served as the Screenwriter, Producer, Director,
            and Editor. The film took ten days to film and is presently 50 minutes long.</p>
